# Tailwind Portfolio

This aim for this project was to use as many different Tailwind CSS utlity classes as possible so that using the library became second nature to me and I wouldn't need to spend as much time refering to the documentation.

For the project I created a 'typical' developer portfolio and had quite a bit of fun implementing the design.

Tailwind has a brilliant system for applying dark and light modes, so I implemented that into the project and took it a step further by conditionally changing the design depending on the chosen mode.

Through Tailwind utility classes I made use of typical layout systems with grid and flexbox, and I built this project in a 'mobile-first' way which is how tailwind is designed to be used.

Features:

- Light and Dark modes.

- Mobile first design.

- Fully responsive across all common device breakpoints.
